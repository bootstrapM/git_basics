# git_basics

to initiate a directory with git do ```git int```

instead to clone from a remote directory do ```git clone <url>```

```git status``` shows (1) the current branch (2) the modified or unstaged files in the current working directory

```git add <file_name>``` this command stages all file as it looks at the time of executing the command which are ready to be committed

if you want to stage all the modified file instead use ```git add *```

```git commit -m "<message>"``` commits the staged files

```git branch``` displays the curent branch

```git branch <new_branch_name>``` creates a new branch

to change branch we use ```git checkout <branch_name>```
